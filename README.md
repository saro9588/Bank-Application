## Bank APP
This is a full stack banking application using the React library in a docker container utilizing DigitalOcean. 
Will use MongoDB for data storage and AWS for deployment. 
Enhanced the application by not allowing negative amount to be deposited and disabling buttons when no entry is made.

you can see the app live at:

## Road Map of Future Improvements
This is just the front-end of the App. I am currently working on adding the back-end part.
1. Currently, data is being stored in the JSON format in an object on a page inside the app. Next step is to connect the app to a cloud database. 
2. The log in page is not functional at this moment because there is no database to store the users created, nor an API to make calls to that database.
3. I will add additional CSS to make the app more UI friendly and look nicer!
